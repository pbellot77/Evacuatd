# Evacuatd
(2016) Written in Swift 3.0

Evacuatd is an app that you will never need to use. In the case of evacuation from fire, storms, flooding, earthquakes or other emergencies, Evacuatd will share your status and your location with your groups in case of emergency.

Create groups of family and friends, from your contacts, who you would want to notify of your location and status during times of distress
